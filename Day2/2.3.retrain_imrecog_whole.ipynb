This requires far fewer parameters, so the model is very small and efficient compared to a model with the same depth using 2D convolution. \n",

    "A bottleneck layer contains few nodes compared to the previous layers, used to obtain a representation of the input with reduced dimensionality, leading to large savings in computational cost. Residual layers connect the beginning and end of a convolutional layers with a skip connection, which gives the network access to earlier activations that weren’t modified in the convolutional layers, and make very deep networks without commensurate increases in parameters. Inverted residuals are a type of residual layer that has fewer parameters, which leads to greater computational efficiency. A ‘linear’ bottleneck is where the last convolution of a residual layer has a linear output before it is added to the initial activations. This preserves more information than the more-traditional non-linear bottlenecks, which leads to greater accuracy."

    "Once the bottlenecks are complete, the actual training of the top layer of the network begins. You'll see a series of step outputs, each one showing training accuracy, validation accuracy, and the cross entropy. The training accuracy shows what percent of the images used in the current training batch were labeled with the correct class. The validation accuracy is the precision on a randomly-selected group of images from a different set. The key difference is that the training accuracy is based on images that the network has been able to learn from so the network can overfit to the noise in the training data. A true measure of the performance of the network is to measure its performance on a data set not contained in the training data -- this is measured by the validation accuracy. If the train accuracy is high but the validation accuracy remains low, that means the network is overfitting and memorizing particular features in the training images that aren't helpful more generally. Cross entropy is a loss function which gives a glimpse into how well the learning process is progressing. The training's objective is to make the loss as small as possible, so you can tell if the learning is working by keeping an eye on whether the loss keeps trending downwards, ignoring the short-term noise.\n",

Each step chooses ten images at random from the training set, finds their bottlenecks from the cache, and feeds them into the final layer to get predictions. Those predictions are then compared against the actual labels to update the final layer's weights through the back-propagation process. As the process continues you should see the reported accuracy improve, and after all the steps are done, a final test accuracy evaluation is run on a set of images kept separate from the training and validation pictures. This test evaluation is the best estimate of how the trained model will perform on the classification task. You should see an accuracy value of between 90% and 95%, though the exact value will vary from run to run since there's randomness in the training process. This number is based on the percent of the images in the test set that are given the correct label after the model is fully trained."
